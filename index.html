            <p>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children be
                introduced to foods other than breast milk or infant formula when they are about 6 months old.
            </p>
            <p> Introducing foods before 4 months old is not recommended. Every child is different. How do you know if
                your child is ready for foods other than breast milk or infant formula?
                You can look for these signs that your child is developmentally ready.

            <div class="par-require">


                Your child:
                <ul class="list-require">
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Sits up alone or with support.</li>
                    <li> <i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Is able to control head and neck.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Opens the mouth when food is offered.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Swallows food rather than pushes it back out onto the chin.
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Brings objects to the mouth.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Tries to grasp small objects, such as toys or food.</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-baby"></i> Transfers food from the front to the back of the tongue to

            <div class="bottom-pag">
                <p> Let your child try one single-ingredient food at a time at first.
                    This helps you see if your child has any problems with that food, such as food allergies.
                    Wait 3 to 5 days between each new food.
                    Before you know it, your child will be on his or her way to eating and enjoying lots of new foods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Introduce potentially allergenic foods when other foods are introduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Potentially allergenic foods include:
                    Cow's milk products, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and sesame.
                    Drinking cow's milk or fortified soy beverages is not recommended until your child is older than 12
                    months, but other cow's milk products, such as yogurt, can be introduced before 12 months.
                    If your child has severe eczema and/or egg allergy, talk with your child's doctor or nurse about
                    when
                    and how to safely introduce foods with peanuts.</p>
